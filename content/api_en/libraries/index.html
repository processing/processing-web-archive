<p class="libraries-bottom">
	Contributed Libraries must be downloaded individually. Select "Add Library..." from the 
	"Import Library..." submenu within the Sketch menu. Not all available libraries have been
	converted to show up in "Add Library...". If a library isn't there, it will need to be 
	installed manually. Follow the 
	<a href="http://wiki.processing.org/w/How_to_Install_a_Contributed_Library">How to Install a 
	Contributed Library</a> instructions on the Processing Wiki for more information.
</p>

<p>
	Contributed libraries are developed, documented, and maintained by members of the Processing 
	community. For feedback and support, please post to the <a href="http://forum.processing.org">
	Forum</a>. For development discussions post to the 
	<a href="http://forum.processing.org/two/categories/create-announce-libraries">Create & Announce Libraries</a> 
	topic. Instructions for creating your own library are on the <a href="https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki">
