With the "@pjs globalKeyEvents" directive you can catch all key events on the window your sketch is running in. You can set it with the "Playback Settings" tool in the "JavaScript" menu.

<description><![CDATA[
The <b>keyTyped()</b> function is called once every time a key is pressed, but action keys such as Ctrl, Shift, and Alt are ignored. Because of how operating systems handle key repeats, holding down a key will cause multiple calls to <b>keyTyped()</b>, the rate is set by the operating system and how each computer is configured. 
<br/><br/>
Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has <b>draw()</b>. Without <b>draw()</b>, the code is only run once and then stops listening for events.
