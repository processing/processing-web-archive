With the "@pjs globalKeyEvents" directive you can catch all key events on the window your sketch is running in. You can set it with the "Playback Settings" tool in the "JavaScript" menu.

<description><![CDATA[
The <b>keyReleased()</b> function is called once every time a key is released. The key that was released will be stored in the <b>key</b> variable. See <b>key</b> and <b>keyReleased</b> for more information.
<br/><br/>
Mouse and keyboard events only work when a program has <b>draw()</b>. Without <b>draw()</b>, the code is only run once and then stops listening for events.
